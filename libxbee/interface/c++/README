Simply run `make`, and it will build libxbee.o and libxbee_cpp.so.

You can either install libxbee_cpp.so on your system, or include libxbee.o
in your project.

If you wish to cross compile the interface, you can edit the CROSS_COMPILE
variable in the makefile, or provide it on the command line.

The class prototype is provided in xbee.h, so no new headers are required.
